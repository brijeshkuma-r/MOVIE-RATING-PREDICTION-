Objective The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that estimates movie ratings based on various features of movies. This model aims to help stakeholders like movie studios, critics, and audiences make informed decisions by predicting the ratings that movies are likely to receive.

Dataset The dataset used for this project is IMDb Movies India.csv, which contains information about various movies including:

Movie Title (Name): The name of the movie. Year: The year of release. Genre: The genre(s) of the movie. Duration: The length of the movie in minutes. Director: The director of the movie. Actors: The main actors involved in the movie. Votes: The number of votes received on IMDb. Rating: The IMDb rating of the movie. Methodology Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Handle Missing Values: Remove or impute missing values in key columns like Actor 1, Actor 2, Actor 3, Director, and Genre. Feature Conversion: Convert non-numeric values in Votes and Duration to numeric types. Specifically, remove commas from the Votes column and 'min' from the Duration column. Remove Outliers: Identify and handle any outliers in the data to ensure the model's robustness. Feature Selection

Feature Engineering: Select relevant features for the prediction model. For this project, features include Votes and Duration. Target Variable: The target variable is Rating, which is the value we aim to predict. Data Exploration

Visualization: Create various plots to understand the data better. This includes: Distribution of top movies by rating. Counts of movies in different genres. Average ratings of top directors. Relationship between votes and ratings. Top actors by number of movies. Number of movies released each year. Correlation Analysis: Analyze correlations between features and the target variable to identify significant predictors. Model Building

Train-Test Split: Divide the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance. Model Selection: Train various regression models to predict movie ratings. For this project, we use: Linear Regression: A model to predict ratings based on selected features. Decision Tree Regressor: Another regression model for comparison. Evaluation

Performance Metrics: Evaluate the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared Score to determine its accuracy and robustness. Expected Outcomes Prediction Model: A trained regression model capable of predicting movie ratings based on features like Votes and Duration. Insights: Detailed insights into how different features impact movie ratings and which factors are most influential. Visualizations: Clear and informative visualizations to support data analysis and model evaluation. Applications Movie Studios: Understand potential ratings for upcoming releases. Critics and Audiences: Gain insights into the expected success of movies based on available features. Marketing: Tailor marketing strategies based on predicted ratings and target demographics.
